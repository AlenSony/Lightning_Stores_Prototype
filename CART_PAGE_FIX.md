# Cart Page Fix Summary

I've identified and fixed several issues that were preventing your cart page from displaying properly:

## Issues Fixed

1. **Undefined function reference in Navbar.jsx**
   - Removed the problematic `onFocus={() => searchQuery && setShowResults(true)}` handler from the search input
   - This was causing a runtime error because `setShowResults` wasn't defined in the component

2. **React StrictMode import issue in main.jsx**
   - Fixed the incorrect import of StrictMode which was causing rendering issues
   - Now correctly importing: `import React, { StrictMode } from 'react'`

## Created Diagnostic Tools

To help diagnose and test your cart functionality, I've created:

1. **test-cart.html** - A simple HTML page you can open in any browser to:
   - Add test items to your cart localStorage
   - View current cart contents
   - Clear the cart
   - This helps verify if the issue is with data storage or rendering

2. **test-cart.js** - A Node.js script to test cart functionality from the command line

3. **CartPage.test.js** - A basic test script for the CartPage component

## Steps to Verify Fix

1. **Open the test page:**
   - Double-click on `test-cart.html` to open it in your browser
   - Click "Add Test Item to Cart" to add a sample product
   - Click "View Cart" to verify the item was added correctly

2. **Check if the cart page works:**
   - Open your application (when the development server is running)
   - Click on the cart icon in the navbar
   - The cart page should now display with the test item

## If Issues Persist

If the cart page still doesn't display properly:

1. **Check the browser console for errors:**
   - Press F12 (Chrome/Firefox) or Cmd+Option+I (Safari) to open developer tools
   - Look for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the page from rendering

2. **Verify navigation routing:**
   - Make sure you're accessing the correct URL path: `/cart`
   - Check that the Navbar's cart button correctly links to `/cart`

3. **Run the development server manually:**
   - Open Command Prompt in the project folder
   - Run `npm install` first to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server

4. **Test with different browsers:**
   - Try accessing the cart page in different browsers to rule out browser-specific issues

## Additional Notes

- The cart functionality uses localStorage to persist items between page reloads
- The cart page will display an "empty cart" message if no items are found in localStorage
- If you see the empty cart message but have items in your cart, check if localStorage is enabled in your browser

If you need further assistance, please provide the error messages from your browser console and I'll help diagnose the issue further.
